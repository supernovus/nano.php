# Nano.php v4

## Notice

Nano.php v4 is now deprecated. As a lot of applications I've written are 
using it, I'm keeping it around for a while, but going forward everything 
will be migrated to Nano.php v5.

## Summary

Nano is a PHP toolkit for building web application frameworks.

The core library is a small object that loads plugins which give it
different abilities as required by your application needs.

Several extendable abstract classes for controllers and models are included, 
as well as a URL-based dispatch plugin, configuration plugin, and a set of
simple helper libraries providing some useful functions for your applications.

## Requirements

* A Unix-based operating system, or compatibility layer.
* PHP 5.6 or higher. PHP 7.x is recommended.
* A bourne compatible shell such as Bash for the .sh scripts in 'bin/'.
* The Perl 5 'prove' utility for 'bin/test.sh'.
* The 'rsync', 'find', 'xargs', and 'perl' utilities for 'bin/initapp.php'.
* The phpDocumentor application if you want to build the API documents.

## Usage

Right now this collection of libraries is mostly used by myself for my own 
projects. I am working on a friendly script that will use templates to build
skeleton applications that you can fill out from there, but it's not yet
finished. Feel free to browse the source for anything useful.

Many parts of this library set are designed to work with the
[Nano.js](https://github.com/supernovus/nano.js) libraries for client side
scripting. In the future further Nano themed library sets may be released.
